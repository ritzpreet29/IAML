    "## Description of the dataset\n",
    "In this assignment our goal is to recognize objects in images of realistic scenes. There are 19 different classes of object e.g. person, dog, cat, car, etc. The dataset derives from several thousands photographs harvested from the web. Each object of a relevant class has been manually annotated with a bounding box. Images can contain none, one or multiple objects of each class. We have prepared a [website](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/iaml/2014/assts/asst3/images.html) where you can view the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to detect whether images contain a person or not - a binary classification problem. To save you time and to make the problem manageable with limited computational resources, we have preprocessed the dataset. We will use the [Bag of Visual Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model_in_computer_vision) representation. Each column of the dataset (which is not an lable), refers to a 'visual word'. Each image is represented by a 500 dimensional vector that contains the normalized count for each of 500 different visual words present in the respective image (a similar representation is used for the spambase dataset, just for real words). See the Appendix at the bottom of the notebook for more information. The image data is thus a $N \\times 500$ dimensional matrix where `N` is the number of images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The full dataset has 520 attributes (dimensions). The first attribute (`imgID`) contains the image ID which allows you to associate a data point with an actual image. The next 500 attributes (`dim1`, ..., `dim500`) are a normalized count vector for each visual word. The last 19 attributes (`is_class`) are the labels - 1 means the class is present in the image. In most of the experiments (unless explicitly noted otherwise) you will only need the `is_person` attribute and the 500 dimensional feature vector. **Do not use the additional class indicator attributes as features** unless explicitly told to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part A we provide you with a training (`train_images partA.csv`) and a validation (`valid_images partA .csv`) dataset. In Part B we provide three data sets: a training set (`train_images partB.csv`), a validation set (`valid_images partB.csv`), and a test set (`test_images partB.csv`). The training and validation set contain valid labels. In the test set the labels are missing. The files are available from the GitHub repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: *Throughout the assignment you will be given various versions of the dataset that are relevant\n",
    "to a particular question. Please be careful to use the correct version of the dataset when instructed to do so.\n",
    "If you use the wrong version of the dataset by mistake no marks will be awarded.*"

    "So far we have used default settings for training the logistic regression classifier. Now, we want to use [K-fold cross-validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html) to optimise the regularisation parameter `C`. The regularisation parameter controls the degree to which we wish to penalise large magnitudes in the weight vector. This can help us prevent overfitting but, if set too high, could lead us to underfit too.\n",

You can specify the range for the `C` parameter, as well as the cross-validation method you want to use with the `Cs` and `cv` parameters, respectively. Use the `C` range you set up in Question 1.12 and the 3-fold cross-validation iterator from Question 1.11. Once again, train the models by using the `lbfgs` optimisation method and display the optimal value for the parameter `C`. Finally, display the classification accuracy on the validation set.

    "At this point, we would like to get an idea of what kind of decision boundaries we can get with the three types of SVM kernels we introduced in the previous question. For visualisation, however, we can only make use of 2D input data. For this purpose, we select to use the 21st and 76th columns of our training features (*hint: remember that Python uses 0-based indexing*). \n",

    "* a linear SVC\n",
    "* an RBF SVC \n",
    "* a polynomial SVC\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, create a list containing the three classifiers you have just trained. Use this list as an input to the provided function along with the used training features and observe the outcome. You can use the additional `title` parameter to set the titles in the subplots. Comment on the shape of the boundaries and what this means for classification accuracy in 1-2 sentences.\n",

Furthermore, a Linear SVM does not do as well with data from images because these are continuous data. RBF has the most relevant separating hyperplane because it can fit smooth solutions for image classifying.  "

Set the kernel coefficient parameter `gamma` to `auto` for this question. \n",

    "You might have noticted that so far, we have used cross-validation for optimising the various tuning parameters (e.g. regularisation parameter in logistic regression, SVM kernel parameters) rather than hold-out validation, although we did have access to a validation set. Why do you think this is a good/bad idea? Give one advantage and one disadvantage of the two different approaches. Which one would you trust more in practice?"

An advantage of hold-out is that it is not computationally expensive since it doesn't need to train many sets. It's also simple to implement in comparison to many other methods.\n",

    "Cross validation is good because it matters less how the data is divided. Each data point gets tested once but is repeatedly used in training, k times. Another advantage is that it works great for small samples since we don't need to leave any out. However, k times as many sets means k times the amount of computation, from scratch, is required making this a an expensive validation model to run. Furthermore, a small data set would bring about higher error rates.\n",

You can also employ any lessons learnt during the course, either from previous Assignments, the Labs or the lecture material to try and squeeze out as much performance as you possibly can.

    "**Important:** The classification performance metric that we will use for this part is the *cross-entropy* or *logarithmic loss* (see the labs). You should familiarise yourself with the metric by reading the `sklearn` [user guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#log-loss) and [documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.log_loss.html#sklearn.metrics.log_loss). To estimate this metric you will need to evaluate probability outputs, as opposed to discrete predictions which we have used so far to compute classification accuracies. Most models in `sklearn` implement a `predict_proba()` method which returns the probabilities for each class. For instance, if your test set consists of `N` datapoints and there are `K` classes, the method will return a `N` x `K` matrix."

    "I've fit a total of 6 classifiers. \n",
    "\n",
    "First I looked at Support Vector Machines (Linear, Radial Bias Function and Polynomial). Linear performed horribly, probably since they have linear decision boundaries or intersecting hyperplanes which didn't work well with our data. Of the two more flexible kernel models, polynomial did best (0.692). However, running the SVM's were computationally expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, I fit a Gaussian Naive Bayes, I got a log loss score of 18.18. This extremely bad score can be explained by a number of things. First, Naive Bayes is easily affected by the presence of outliers. It's also usually used for text data not image data. Instead of removing the outliers, first I tried fitting a Random Forest classifier on the data (as this classifier is not sensitive to outliers. The results are exponentially better (0.5825). In fact, increasing the number of trees (n_estimators), lowers the log loss further though the more trees we use, the more computationally expensive it is. I set mine to 5000 as this seemed like a reasonable amount of time to wait for a better log loss. Furthermore, this also means less overfitting since the classifier averages the results over so many trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because RF worked well, I tried Decision Trees and Extra Trees but neither produced better results. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also tried fitting a Nearest Neighbours model but this also gave a high log loss, showing bad results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next I created an ensemble with the two best performing classifiers: Polynomial SVM and Random Forest. This yielded results worse than RF but better than the polynomial SVM model individually. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, most did better than the DummyClassifier though not all. \n",
    "\n",
    "FURTHER FEATURE ENGINEERING \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that I've tried multiple classifiers, it is clear that polynomial SVM and RF are worth looking into further. Here I would have liked to further normalize or standardize the data before refitting to see if feature engineering would better my log loss for any of the short listed classifiers but it is too compuationally expensive to run it now. If I could, I would have tuned the gamma and C parameters. I would also have liked to normalize the data using log or square root. \n",

    "Visual words are based on [Scale-invariant feature transforms (SIFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform). SIFT features are essentially local orientation histograms and capture the properties of small image regions. They possess attractive invariance properties which make them well suited for our task (you can read more about SIFT features in [D.Lowe, IJCV 60(2):91- 110, 2004](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94), but the details don't matter for the purpose of this assignment). Each SIFT feature is a 128 dimensional vector. From each image many SIFT features are extracted, typically > 2500 per image (features are extracted at regular intervals using a 15 pixel grid and at 4 different scales). To obtain visual words a representative subset of all extracted SIFT features from all images is chosen and clustered with k-means using 500 centres (such use of the k-means algorithm will be discussed in detail during the lecture). These 500 cluster centres form our visual words. The representation of a single image is obtained by first assigning each SIFT feature extracted from the image to the appropriate cluster (i.e. we determine the visual word corresponding to each feature by picking the closest cluster centre). We then count the number of features from that image assigned to each cluster (i.e. we determine how often each visual word is present in the image). This results in a 500 dimensional count vector for each image (one dimension for each visual word). The normalized version of this count vector gives the final representation of the image (normalized means that we divide the count vector by the total number of visual words in the image, i.e. the normalized counts sum to 1 for each image)"
